# 📈 Samriddhi – Rural Bond Liquidity Platform  

### 📌 Overview  
Samriddhi is an MVP built for the **Securities Market Hackathon organized by SEBI**.  
It addresses the chronic liquidity challenge in India’s bond markets by connecting rural investors — both individuals and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) — to government bonds.  

The platform demonstrates how rural participation can:  
- Unlock new retail liquidity pools  
- Empower excluded communities with better returns  
- Improve market efficiency through stronger price discovery  

---

## 🚩 Problem  
- Indian bond markets suffer from **low liquidity**, making it difficult for institutions to exit positions due to weak retail participation.  
- At the same time, **800M+ rural Indians** remain excluded from formal investments, with over ₹15 lakh crore in savings earning less than 4% annually.

## 💡 Solution  
Samriddhi bridges this gap by:  
- Enabling rural investors and SHGs to **buy and sell government bonds**  
- Providing **simple authentication** (OTP + 4-digit PIN)  
- Offering a **bilingual interface** (Hindi/English) for accessibility  
- Supporting **democratic SHG voting** for group decisions  
- Delivering **portfolio tracking, KYC management, and financial literacy modules**  

This dual approach expands participation, deepens liquidity, and improves price discovery in bond markets.
